# 2022-11-03 Prepayments Are Not Being Applied Automatically For Remittance Invoice

As of November 3rd, 2022, the logic of applying prepayments automatically is being changed.

Previously, we applied prepayments automatically while issuing an invoice only in the cases you had a collection method set to "remittance" or you didn't have net terms set.

Now, we apply prepayments automatically only in the case you don't have net terms set, regardless of what collection method you have set.
