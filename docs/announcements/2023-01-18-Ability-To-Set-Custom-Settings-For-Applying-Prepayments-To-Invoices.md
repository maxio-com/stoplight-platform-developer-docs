# 2023-01-18 Ability to set custom settings for applying prepayments to invoices

As of January 18, 2023, we have added additional options for the manner in which prepayments are applied to invoices. The new options may be found under Config > Settings > Prepayments and the custom settings for applying prepayments to invoices are as follows:

Automatic Payment Collection Method:

- Do not automatically apply prepayments

- Apply available prepayments automatically immediately upon issuance of invoice

- Apply prepayments automatically on the due date (default setting)

Remittance Payment Collection Method:

- Do not automatically apply prepayments

- Apply available prepayments automatically immediately upon issuance of invoice (default setting)

This change was made to allow merchants greater flexibility to ensure prepayments are applied to invoices in a manner that best fits their individual workflow.
