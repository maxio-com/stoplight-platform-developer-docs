# 2022-11-21 Create Successful And Failure Payment Events For Subscription Group Renewal

As of November 21th, 2022, we will now create Successful and Failure Payment Events for the primary subscription after renewal.

This change was made to ensure the renewal behavior works the same as the initial signup making it easier to track subscription group payment activity through the groupâ€™s lifetime.
