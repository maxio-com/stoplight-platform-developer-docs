# 2020-01-16 Coupon Validation Changes

On December 17, 2019 we made an update to how coupon pricing is validated. Previously we would allow a coupon to to be created with a negative amount. If a coupon with a negative amount was applied to a subscription it would get ignored and not attempt to generate a discount, which is the expected behavior.

In order to bring coupon validations in line with the expected behavior, we no longer allow coupons to be created with a negative amount. There were a small percentage of these coupons that we've updated from a negative amount to `0` in order to maintain the existing behavior but keep them valid.

If you have any questions or concerns please contact us at [support@chargify.com](mailto:support@chargify.com) and weâ€™ll be glad to assist.
