# 2023-02-28 Increase in Declines from Stripe Gateway

We have multiple merchants experiencing an increase in declines when storing credit cards within the Stripe payment gateway beginning in early February. Further investigation by our developers did not find any changes on our end that would result in these declines.

Until we receive more direct insight from Stripe on this matter, we recommend that any affected merchants contact Stripe directly. Additionally, customers encountering declines may reach out to their card issuing bank for more information. We have also found multiple instances where a decline succeeds in the future after some time, suggesting these declines may not be permanent errors.

We understand the inconvenience these increased declines may cause, and will provide further updates as soon as we have more information to share.
