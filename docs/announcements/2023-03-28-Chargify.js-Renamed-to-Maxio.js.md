# 2023-03-28 Chargify.js renamed to Maxio.js
Chargify.js has been renamed to Maxio.js, and will be referenced in the documentation as both “Maxio.js” and “Maxio.js (previously Chargify.js)”. This is a plain text change only – there is no functionality impact to your existing Chargify.js implementation, and there are no code changes you need to make. Everything functions as it did prior to this name change.
