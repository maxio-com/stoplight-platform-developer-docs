# 2023-02-03 Unintended Renewal Event After The First Dunning Attempt 

We recently released a fix for renewal webhooks on 2023-01-24, however, we regret to inform you that this resulted in unintended consequences causing the webhooks to trigger daily after the first dunning attempt. Our development team quickly identified and resolved the issue, ensuring that the renewal webhooks will now only trigger on the normal renewal dates.

We understand that this situation may have caused some inconvenience, and we would like to extend our sincerest apologies for any disruption. We are committed to providing our customers with the best possible service and we appreciate your patience and understanding during this time.
