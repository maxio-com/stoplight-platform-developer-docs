# Introduction

## Deprecation

| ❗️  Please note that Chargify Direct has been deprecated in favor of Chargify.js and its support for multi-gateways is limited only to default gateways  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Chargify.js is a PCI compliant way of embedding payment forms on your site, while still making full use of our powerful API.

While Chargify Direct will still function and be supported, no new enhancements or features will be added.

## Chargify Direct

Chargify Direct allows you to create Chargify resources (such as subscriptions) via a form on your own website that posts directly to Chargify. After Chargify receives the form submission, the user is redirected back to your own site. The redirection communicates the result of the submission so that your website can decide how to respond to the user. This flow is sometimes called “transparent redirect” within the industry.

## Implementation Notes

Chargify Direct usually requires a more technically experienced customer, and sometimes requires our Technical Support Specialists during implementation. 

You’re welcome to use Chargify Direct on any plan, but please note that if you need assistance, we will ask that you be on a plan that includes advanced tech support.

Please note that Chargify Direct currently doesn’t support creating Invoice Billing subscriptions.
