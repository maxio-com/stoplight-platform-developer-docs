# Ecosystem

One of the many reasons to use Chargify is the immense feature set and surrounding community.

## Integrations

Chargify has partnered with many SaaS solutions to help you manage your business. The complete list of integrations is available [here](https://www.chargify.com/integration-marketplace/).

For more information about existing integrations, please see [integrations](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407720955803).

## Account

Your account can be reached upon logging in at [https://app.chargify.com/login](https://app.chargify.com/login).

## Development

If you’re having difficulty executing a request via our API, try the simplest thing and attempt your request via the curl command-line tool, as shown in the below example. Add the `--verbose` flag to your request to receive even more debugging information.

Another handy tool is [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) You could send your request to their temporary URL instead of us to see visually what it is you’re sending, if you’re not sure.

While you can certainly write your own code to interact with Chargify, it's likely someone has already written code for your platform.

### Security

**TLS/SSL**

As of January 12, 2016 (approximated 9:00am ET) Chargify now no longer supports TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1 over HTTPS on the chargify.com domain. Any older browsers or API clients that do not support TLS 1.2 will no longer work. This change is mandated by the PCI Security Council and affects all merchants and service providers processing or transmitting credit card data.

For more information, please see our [help article on security](https://chargify.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407747268763).
