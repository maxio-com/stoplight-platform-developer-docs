# Version History

The latest version of `chargify.js` is available at the following url:

```html
<script src="https://js.chargify.com/latest/chargify.js"></script>
```

We occasionally make updates to improve the functionality of Chargify.js in
accordance with our [backwards compatibility policy.](https://developers.chargify.com/docs/api-docs/YXBpOjE0MTA4MjYx-chargify-api#backwards-compatibility)

With every release of Chargify.js, we also publish a static version.
If needed, you can point to a specific version using a release date as shown below in the release history.
In this way you can control when the Chargify.js updates occur and test them with your
integration, or implement a Content Security Policy (CSP).  Example:

```html
<script src="https://js.chargify.com/v/2021-01-29a/chargify.js"></script>
```

❗️ We will support previous releases of Chargify.js for a maximum time frame of 6 months. If you use an explicitly versioned path of Chargify.js, you must commit to updating your integration regularly.  Versions older than 6 months will be unsupported and may be removed without notice.
